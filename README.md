2021 Australia Census - 1

In this project, we study the data cube published by ASB about 2021 national census.

We are trying to answer 3 questions here:
  1. What is the distribution of Australian weekly income?
  2. Which 5 areas have the most population who make $0 or negative weekly income?
  3. Which 5 areas have the most population who make $3500+ weekly income?
